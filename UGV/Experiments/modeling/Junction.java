/**
 * This class will describe an intersection, or junction which can be of type T or X, and
 * which is used for enforcing 'special' driving behaviour in the vicinity of a junction
 * e.g. slow down to stop, 3/4 way stop behaviour.  Vehicles will need to be aware that they
 * are approaching a junction in order to adapt their behaviour accordingly.  The junctions
 * will be stored as 'point' objects corresponding to the centre of the junction, they will
 * be drawn as squares (rectangles with a length and width equal to Road.roadWidth), and they 
 * will have methods for representing themselves as a small square like the above, or a larger
 * square which will include the junction approaches where vehicles may need to start to slow
 * down.
